Renarration web application
The ability to modify the existing published web pages is what we are calling Renarration of the web. Such a mechanism is useful for improving accessibility and personalization of the content currently on the web.

 Renarration is the label being used for any alternate articulation of an original web source.
 For instance, a translated text, an annotated image or a audio replacement of some original web source can all be considered as renarrations.
